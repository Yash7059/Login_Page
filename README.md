-   **Efficient Form Management**: Utilizes `react-hook-form` for high-performance, hook-based form state management without unnecessary re-renders.
-   **Client-Side Validation**: Implements real-time validation for:
    -   Required fields
    -   Minimum and maximum character length
-   **Dynamic Error Display**: Instantly shows clear, user-friendly error messages next to the invalid fields.
-   **Asynchronous Submission**: Simulates an API call with a 2-second delay to demonstrate handling of loading states.
-   **User Feedback**:
    -   Displays a "Loading..." overlay and disables the submit button during submission to prevent multiple clicks.
    -   Shows an `alert` on successful login.
    -   Displays a specific "Invalid credentials" error after a failed submission attempt.
-   **Modern UI**: Styled with clean, responsive CSS for a great user experience.
